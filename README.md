## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me improve my understanding of both backend and UI systems in RedM:

- 🧠 **Event-driven logic**  
  Working with chat events and player messaging reinforced clean server/client communication.

- 🎨 **UI Development (HTML, CSS, JS)**  
  Building the chat UI improved my understanding of structuring interfaces, handling input, and updating the UI dynamically.

- ⚙️ **Performance considerations**  
  Keeping the chat lightweight required being mindful of how often events fire and how data is handled.

- 🧩 **Standalone design**  
  Designing the system without a framework helped me write more modular and reusable code.
